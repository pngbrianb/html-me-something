    <h1>The Tale of Crazmo the Dragon</h1>
    <h5> A "story" improvised by Brian Brakefield </h5>

    <p> Twas in the twelfth year of Gunderard that the egg of Crazmo hatched. A small crack in the shell, an arhythmic beating against its inside, punctuated by occacional puffs of steam as the monster within sought to burn its way out into the world of mortals. </p>
    <p> When the shell finally fell apart, it was with much thrashing and kicking of tiny legs, a flick of a tiny tail, and the swiping of toes whose claws had not yet grown in. A dragon, its wings limp and useless and its skin as yellow as old paper, cried its tea kettle wail into this new, uncomfortable world. </p>
    <p> But the cry of the newborn dragon went unheard, for dragons are not familial by nature. So, after a bit of crying, the wee dragon hatchling flopped down to sleep among the shell fragments of the only home it had known and had a single, sleepy thought before it drifted away. "I shall call myself Crazmo. If I have a name, then I can be known. And by being known, I can exist." </p>

    <p> At this point, fair reader, you may guess that this is not so much a complete story as a collection of paragraphs invented using the first words to come to the writer's head. In believing the content of the project to be less important than the medium in which it is delivered, a strange attempt at narrative was begun and quickly abondoned. I apologize for your lost time. </p>

    <p> Of course, I acknowledge that I've done the bare minimum as set out in the assignment instructions. The question is: is the bare minimum good enough? </p>
